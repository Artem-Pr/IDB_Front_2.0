---

## ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS:

I need to add new functionality to Search menu:
1. add button "Add exif filter" bellow Description filter.
2. When user clicks on this button, then new filter should appear before "Add exif filter" button, and the button should be moved bellow.
3. New filter: Antd Select with autocomplete mode with placeholder - "Select exif property".
4. When user select property, then property condition component should appear at the right side of selector. Property condition component will be different depends on type of Exif field (i will explain it later)
5. User can add as many new filter as he wants by clicking "Add exif filter" button.

API:
api shape for getting paginated list of exif filters: 
{
    "exifKeys": [
        {
            "_id": "685aaff61bf3ec0ddd1af205",
            "name": "errors",
            "type": "NOT_SUPPORTED"
        },
        {
            "_id": "685aaff61bf3ec0ddd1af266",
            "name": "warnings",
            "type": "NOT_SUPPORTED"
        }
    ],
    "page": 22,
    "perPage": 5,
    "resultsCount": 107,
    "totalPages": 22
}


additional context:
export enum ExifValueType {
  STRING = 'string',
  LONG_STRING = 'long_string',
  NUMBER = 'number',
  STRING_ARRAY = 'string[]',
  NOT_SUPPORTED = 'NOT_SUPPORTED',
}
(to create Select exif property selector component you can use the same logic as we use for DescriptionAutoComplete, API shape should be similar. but please avoid duplicating of the same logic, better to make helpers or hooks that contain will be reused in both places)

depends of exifKeys.type we should show different components:
type === NOT_SUPPORTED -> on/off switcher with "is exist" label
type === LONG_STRING -> the same component as DescriptionAutoComplete
type === STRING_ARRAY -> antd multiselect component with autocomplete logic
type === STRING -> antd multiselect component with autocomplete logic
type === NUMBER -> by default: antd multiselect component with autocomplete logic. But before component add checkbox: "Range". If user checked this checkbox, then component will be switched to Range component (2 InputNumber Antd components). Additionally, we need to show max and min value and add validation to prevent having values out of range

each component, except NOT_SUPPORTED, should fetch data to be able to select them.
this is the API request type:
- **File**: `src/files/exif-values/dto/get-exif-values-input.dto.ts`
  - `exifPropertyName: string` (required)
  - `page?: number` (default: 1)
  - `perPage?: number` (default: 50)

this is the API response type:
- **File**: `src/files/exif-values/dto/get-exif-values-output.dto.ts`
  - `values: (string | number)[]`
  - `page: number`
  - `perPage: number`
  - `totalCount: number`
  - `totalPages: number`
  - `exifPropertyName: string`
  - `valueType : ExifValueType`

to fetch data for Number range, you can use this API request type:
- **File**: `src/files/exif-values/dto/get-exif-value-range-input.dto.ts`
  - `exifPropertyName: string` (required)
and this API response type:
- **File**: `src/files/exif-values/dto/get-exif-value-range-output.dto.ts`
  - `minValue: number`
  - `maxValue: number`
  - `exifPropertyName: string`
  - `count: number` (total number of documents with this property)

### 14. Implementation Details Based on Requirements

1. **Filter Limits**: Limited by `resultsCount` in exif-keys API response. Each EXIF property key can only be used once - need to track and exclude already selected keys from subsequent filter dropdowns.

2. **Error Handling**: Use notification system (same as existing app patterns) for validation errors and API failures.

3. **Data Persistence**: Yes, EXIF filters should be persisted in localStorage like other search filters.

4. **Filter Reordering**: Not needed - filters will be displayed in the order they were added.

5. **Long Filter Values**: Handle using DescriptionAutoComplete pattern when filter values are long text.

6. **Long Property Names**: Handled automatically by Antd Select component.

### 15. Additional Implementation Requirements

**API Call Behavior:**
- **exif-keys API**: Called with pagination and searchTerm when user types in property selector (autocomplete behavior)
- **exif-values API**: Called immediately when user selects an EXIF property (no debounce needed)
- **exif-value-range API**: Called immediately when user switches to range mode for NUMBER type

**Component State Management:**
- Use component state (like DescriptionAutoComplete) instead of Redux for API data that doesn't need to be shared
- Only use Redux for the actual filter values that need to be persisted and shared across components
- Keep API loading states and fetched data in local component state

**Key Uniqueness Logic:**
- Track selected EXIF property names in ExifFiltersContainer state
- Filter available options in ExifPropertySelector to exclude already selected properties
- Update available options when filters are added/removed

**Value Selector Components:**
- **Property Selector**: AutoComplete component with pagination (similar to DescriptionAutoComplete)
- **Value Selectors**: Simple Select components with mode="tags" using pre-fetched data from exif-values API
- **Range Selector**: Two InputNumber components with min/max validation from exif-value-range API

**localStorage Integration:**
- Add EXIF filters to the existing localStorage sync mechanism in `src/redux/store/localStorageSync.ts`
- Include `exifFilters` in the searchMenu persistence logic

### 16. Future Improvements (Not in Current Scope)

- **Predefined Quick Filters**: Add common EXIF property shortcuts (e.g., "Camera Make", "GPS Location", "ISO Range") for faster access to frequently used filters
- **Filter Templates**: Save and reuse common filter combinations
- **Advanced Search Operators**: Support for "contains", "starts with", "ends with" for string fields
- **Filter Groups**: Ability to group related EXIF filters with AND/OR logic

## BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. **Code Organization & Architecture**

**Follow Existing Patterns:**
- Use the same folder structure as existing components (components/, hooks/, index.ts files)
- Follow the naming conventions: PascalCase for components, camelCase for hooks
- Use barrel exports (index.ts files) consistently
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibility

**Component Composition:**
- Create reusable, composable components
- Use compound component pattern for complex components (ExifValueCondition with sub-components)
- Extract common logic into custom hooks
- Use render props or component composition over inheritance

### 2. **TypeScript Best Practices**

**Type Safety:**
- Use strict TypeScript - no `any` types
- Create proper interfaces for all props and state
- Use union types for ExifValueType conditions
- Implement type guards where needed for runtime type checking
- Use generic types for reusable hooks (useAutocompleteData<T>)

**Type Organization:**
- Keep types close to where they're used
- Export types from index.ts files for external consumption
- Use const assertions for immutable data
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes

### 3. **React Best Practices**

**Performance:**
- Use React.memo for components that receive stable props
- Implement useMemo and useCallback for expensive calculations and stable references
- Use proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Avoid creating objects/functions in render (move to useMemo/useCallback)

**State Management:**
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Use Redux for shared state across components
- Batch Redux actions when multiple updates needed
- Use proper action creators following existing patterns
- Don't use Redux if it's not required, try to keep fetched data inside component state (example: DescriptionAutoComplete.tsx)
- use selectors that return narrow value, avoid using complex object as selector, for example:
  state: {
    complexObject: {
      simpleValue1: 'name',
      simpleValue2: false
    }
  }
  good approach:
      const simpleValue1 = useSelector(getSimpleValue1)
      const simpleValue2 = useSelector(getSimpleValue2)
  bad approach:
      const {simpleValue1, simpleValue2} = useSelector(getComplexObject)

  and make sure you don't update whole complexObject if just one of fields changed 

**Hooks:**
- Follow hooks rules (only call at top level)
- Create custom hooks for reusable stateful logic
- Use proper cleanup in useEffect (return cleanup functions)
- Implement proper error boundaries for components

### 4. **Redux Best Practices**

**State Structure:**
- Keep state normalized and flat
- Use proper immutable updates with current() helper
- Follow existing naming conventions for actions/reducers
- Use PayloadAction<T> for typed actions

**Actions & Reducers:**
- Keep actions small and focused
- Use descriptive action names following existing patterns
- Implement proper error handling in async actions
- Use selectors for derived state

### 5. **API Integration Best Practices**

**Error Handling:**
- Use try-catch blocks in async functions
- Implement proper error messages using existing notification system
- Handle network timeouts and connection errors
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

**Loading States:**
- Show loading indicators for all async operations
- Disable user interactions during loading
- Provide skeleton loaders matching existing patterns
- Cancel ongoing requests on component unmount

**Caching & Performance:**
- Implement proper request cancellation using AbortController
- Use debouncing for search inputs (500ms as per existing pattern)
- Cache API responses when appropriate
- Implement pagination properly

### 6. **Component Design Best Practices**

**Props Interface:**
- Use descriptive prop names
- Provide default values where appropriate
- Make required props explicit
- Use union types for controlled variants

**Event Handling:**
- Use consistent naming (handleXxx pattern)
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders with stable references
- Implement proper form validation
- Use controlled components for form inputs

**Styling:**
- Use CSS Modules following existing patterns
- Follow BEM naming convention in CSS classes
- Use existing CSS variables and utility classes
- Ensure responsive design

### 7. **Testing Best Practices**

**Unit Tests:**
- Test component behavior, not implementation details
- Use React Testing Library best practices
- Mock API calls properly
- Test error states and edge cases

**Integration Tests:**
- Test component interactions
- Test Redux state changes
- Test API integration
- Use proper test data setup

### 8. **Accessibility Best Practices**

**ARIA Labels:**
- Add proper aria-label and aria-describedby attributes
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper focus management
- Support keyboard navigation

**Screen Readers:**
- Provide descriptive text for form controls
- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Implement live regions for dynamic content
- Test with screen readers

### 9. **Performance Best Practices**

**Bundle Size:**
- Import only needed parts from libraries
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Implement code splitting where appropriate
- Monitor bundle size impact

**Runtime Performance:**
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use proper key props for lists
- Implement virtualization for large lists
- Profile components with React DevTools

### 10. **Code Quality Best Practices**

**Linting & Formatting:**
- Follow existing ESLint rules
- Use Prettier for consistent formatting
- Fix all linting warnings
- Follow existing code style

**Documentation:**
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Document prop interfaces thoroughly
- Include usage examples in comments
- Keep README files updated

**Git Practices:**
- Make atomic commits
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Use feature branches
- Request code reviews

### 11. **Security Best Practices**

**Input Validation:**
- Sanitize user inputs
- Validate API responses
- Handle malicious input gracefully
- Use proper XSS prevention

**API Security:**
- Use existing authentication patterns
- Validate API responses
- Handle authentication errors properly
- Don't expose sensitive data in client code

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive approach to adding EXIF filters functionality while maintaining consistency with the existing codebase architecture and patterns.
