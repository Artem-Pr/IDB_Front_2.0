# Implementing Node.js Streams for Large Video File Uploads

This document outlines the necessary changes to implement streaming for large video file uploads in the NestJS application.

## 1. Overview

Currently, the application uses Multer with disk storage for file uploads, which loads the entire file into memory before saving it to disk. For large video files, this approach can cause memory issues and slow performance. Implementing Node.js streams will allow for more efficient handling of large files by processing them in chunks.

## 2. Required Changes

### 2.1. Create New DTOs

#### 2.1.1. Create Upload Chunk DTO
2.1.1.1. Create a DTO for handling individual file chunks
2.1.1.2. Include fields for: fileId, chunkIndex, totalChunks, originalname, mimetype
2.1.1.3. Use class-validator decorators for validation

#### 2.1.2. Create Initialize Upload DTO
2.1.2.1. Create a DTO for initializing the upload process
2.1.2.2. Include fields for: originalname, mimetype, fileSize, totalChunks
2.1.2.3. Use class-validator decorators for validation

#### 2.1.3. Create Complete Upload DTO
2.1.3.1. Create a DTO for completing the upload process
2.1.3.2. Include field for: fileId
2.1.3.3. Use class-validator decorators for validation

### 2.2. Create Stream Interceptor

2.2.1. Implement a NestJS interceptor to handle streaming uploads
2.2.2. Intercept the request and extract fileId and chunkIndex
2.2.3. Create a directory structure for storing chunks
2.2.4. Pipe the request to a write stream for the chunk

### 2.3. Create Stream Service

2.3.1. Implement a service to manage the streaming process
2.3.2. Create methods for:
  2.3.2.1. initializeUpload: Generate fileId and create directory for chunks
  2.3.2.2. processChunk: Handle each uploaded chunk
  2.3.2.3. completeUpload: Combine chunks into a single file
2.3.3. Implement proper error handling and cleanup

### 2.4. Update Files Module

2.4.1. Add the StreamService to the providers array
2.4.2. Export the StreamService if needed

### 2.5. Update Files Controller

2.5.1. Add new endpoints:
  2.5.1.1. initializeUpload: Start the upload process
  2.5.1.2. uploadChunk: Handle individual chunk uploads
  2.5.1.3. completeUpload: Finalize the upload and process the file

### 2.6. Update Constants

2.6.1. Add new controller prefixes for the new endpoints

## 3. Client-Side Implementation

### 3.1. Chunking Mechanism

3.1.1. Calculate the total number of chunks based on a reasonable chunk size (e.g., 5MB)
3.1.2. Initialize the upload to get a fileId
3.1.3. Upload each chunk with its index
3.1.4. Complete the upload when all chunks are sent

### 3.2. Using Uppy for Client-Side Implementation

Uppy is a modern JavaScript file uploader that can significantly improve the user experience for large video file uploads. It provides a robust solution with built-in support for chunked uploads, progress tracking, and resumable uploads.

#### 3.2.1. Key Features of Uppy

3.2.1.1. **Chunked Uploads**: Uppy automatically splits large files into smaller chunks, making it ideal for video uploads.
3.2.1.2. **Progress Tracking**: Built-in progress bars for both overall upload and individual files.
3.2.1.3. **Resumable Uploads**: Users can pause and resume uploads, which is crucial for large video files.
3.2.1.4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with automatic retries for failed chunks.
3.2.1.5. **Extensible Plugin System**: Customize the upload experience with various plugins.

#### 3.2.2. Integration with Node.js Streams

Uppy works seamlessly with the Node.js streaming approach outlined in this document.

#### 3.2.3. Server-Side Configuration

On the server side, you'll need to handle the Uppy requests:

3.2.3.1. **Initialize Upload Endpoint**: Creates a temporary directory for chunks and returns a fileId
3.2.3.2. **Upload Chunk Endpoint**: Saves each chunk to the temporary directory
3.2.3.3. **Complete Upload Endpoint**: Combines all chunks and processes the final file

#### 3.2.4. Benefits of Using Uppy

3.2.4.1. **Improved User Experience**: Users can see upload progress and have the ability to pause/resume uploads.
3.2.4.2. **Reduced Server Load**: Chunked uploads distribute the processing load over time.
3.2.4.3. **Better Error Recovery**: Failed chunks can be retried without restarting the entire upload.
3.2.4.4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works consistently across modern browsers.

## 4. Testing Considerations

### 4.1. Testing Approach

4.1.1. Test with various file sizes to ensure the streaming approach works correctly
4.1.2. Implement proper error handling for failed uploads
4.1.3. Add progress tracking for better user experience
4.1.4. Consider implementing resumable uploads for even better user experience

## 5. Security Considerations

### 5.1. Security Measures

5.1.1. Implement proper validation for all incoming chunks
5.1.2. Set a maximum file size limit
5.1.3. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
5.1.4. Clean up temporary files if the upload is abandoned

## 6. Performance Optimizations

### 6.1. Optimization Strategies

6.1.1. Consider using a background job to process the file after it's uploaded
6.1.2. Implement a cleanup job to remove abandoned uploads
6.1.3. Consider using a dedicated storage service for large files

## 7. Conclusion

Implementing Node.js streams for large video file uploads will significantly improve the application's ability to handle large files efficiently. The changes outlined in this document provide a comprehensive approach to implementing streaming uploads while maintaining compatibility with the existing application architecture. Using Uppy on the client side further enhances this solution by providing a robust, user-friendly upload experience with features like chunked uploads, progress tracking, and resumable uploads.
